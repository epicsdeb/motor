<h2>Known problems with Release 6-10 and later</h2>

See issues on github: <a href="https://github.com/epics-modules/motor/issues">https://github.com/epics-modules/motor/issues</a>

<h2>Known problems with Release 6-9</h2>


<h2>Known problems with Release 6-8</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
    <b>Soft-travel Limits</b>
    </p>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Although there are a number of improvements with R6-8's support of soft-travel 
        limits (LVIO), there are also two problems that will remain "Known Problems".
        These limitation are as follows:
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Tweaking (TWF/TWR) very small increments with UEIP = Yes while in the invalid 
          range of the soft-travel limits may put the motor record in a state where the 
          user cannot tweak in either direction. The solution is to either jog the motor 
          towards the valid range or increase the tweak increment value (TWV field).
        </li>
        <li>
          Tapping the Jog button can cause the motor to move past the soft-travel limit 
          when backlash is nonzero.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
    <b>Newport ESP100/300/301</b>
    </p>
    <p>
    The R6.8 ESP support changes made to "Use MRES rather than controller resolution 
    to do EGUtoRAWbacktoEGU conversion." do not work. (Model 1 drivers do not always 
    have access to motor record data.) The most obvious problem with R6.8 ESP 
    support is the inability to "set" the controller's position.
    </p>
    <p>
    <a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/upd/people/sluiter/epics/motor/R6-8/ESPr68.patch">This 
    patch file</a> rolls back the R6.8 ESP changes and adds one bug fix to 
    the EPS100/300/301 driver; when a controller error occurs, the driver prints the 
    error code to the console and sets the RA_PROBLEM bit of the MSTA field. The 
    motor record patch unconditionally sends a "stop motor" command whenever a 
    driver sets the RA_PROBLEM bit. Finally, the patch file updates ESP info in the 
    README file.
    </p>
    <p>
    R6-8-1 includes both the MRES related rollback and the STOP on RA_PROBLEM bug fix.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Known problems with Release 6-7</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
    <b>Aerotech Ensemble</b>
    </p>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Due to network broadcasting upgrades to Aerotech Ensemble Motion Composer, 
        starting with motor module R6-7-1, the EPICS Ensemble driver only supports 
        4.01.002 Ensemble version firmware 4.01.002 and above.
      </li>
      <li>
        The home search from EPICS command was been restored with R6-7-1.  In order for 
        an EPICS home search command to work, the Aerotech Ensemble example program, <i>HomeAsync.abx</i>, 
        must be compiled and stored in the Ensemble.  In addition, the Parameters>System>TaskExecutionSetup 
        parameter must be set to enable Auxiliary Task execution.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
  </li>

  <p>
  <li>
    <p>
    <b>Schneider Electric (formally IMS) MDrive</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe Sullivan fixed several bugs in the Schneider Electric MDrive driver 
      associated with input buffer overflows that arose with newer MDrive firmware (e.g., 
      3.003).  These bug fixes were 1st released with motor module R6-7-1.
    </p>
  </li>
  </p>

</ol>

<h2>Known problems with Release 6-5</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
    <b>Aerotech Ensemble</b>
    </p>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        With previous releases the Aerotech Ensemble asyn motor driver would crash the 
        IOC at boot-up if the Ensemble was not powered up and able to communicate. Fixed 
        with R6-5-1.
      </li>
      <li>
        The EOT limit switch status was not available except via an Ensemble fault 
        condition.  With release R6-5-1 the status of the EOT limit switches are always 
        available.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
  </li>

  <p>
  <li>
    <p>
    <b>OMS MAXv WatchDog Timeout Counter</b>
    </p>
    <p>
    Beginning with R6-5-1 and OMS MAXv firmware ver:1.33, the EPICS MAXv driver reads 
    the MAXv's Watchdog Timeout Counter at bootup, and with every motor status 
    update. If the Counter is nonzero, an error message is sent to both the errlog 
    task and the console.  Since a watchdog timer trip indicates that the MAXv has 
    rebooted and no longer has valid motor positions, the driver disables the 
    controller. That specific controller is no longer available to EPICS until after 
    the VME crate has been power cycled. Other MAXv boards in the system are 
    unaffected by this scenario.
    </p>
    <p>
    To better communicate this problem to the user, several medm displays have been 
    changed.  Small displays (motorx_tiny.adl, motorx.adl) will show a yellow border 
    around their position readback values.  Larger displays (motorx_more.adl, 
    motorx_all.adl) will display the message "Controller Error" in yellow.  The 
    following error message at the console and/or in the errlog is definitive;
    </p>
    <p>
    <center>
      ***MAXv card #<i>(card#)</i> Disabled*** Watchdog Timeout CTR =<i>(count)</i>
    </center>
    </p>
  </li>
  </p>

  <li>
    <p>
    <b>spec upgrade required</b>
    </p>
    <p>
    The RES field was removed from the motor record with R6-5.  Since earlier 
    versions of Certified Scientific Software's spec used the RES field, an upgrade 
    to spec version 5.8.06-6 or above is required for spec to work with motor record 
    R6-5 and above.  The problem of using earlier versions of spec with motor record 
    R6-5 exhibits itself by spec setting the "responsive" parameter to zero and not 
    allowing any motor motion.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
    <b>VxWorks 6.x compiler error</b>
    </p>
    <p>
    The GNU preprocessor assertions in motor.h are deprecated with the VxWorks 6.x 
    compiler.  Test for CPU macros that are compatible with VxWorks 6.x have been 
    added.  This change prevents an "Error: unknown bit order!" compiler error with 
    VxWorks 6.x.  This problem is fixed with R6-5-2 and above. Alternatively, you can 
    replace &lt;motor&gt;/motorApp/MotorSrc/motor.h with the following copy:&nbsp;<a href="/bcda/synApps/motor/R6-5/motor.h">motor.h</a>
    </p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>
    <b>Aerotech Ensemble Home Search</b>
    </p>
    <p>
    The EPICS Ensemble driver uses Aerotech's ASCII communication protocol.  That 
    protocol blocks all communication on the ASCII comm. port during a home search. 
    Consequently, once a home search is started from EPICS, it is unable to stop it. 
    As a result, beginning with R6-5-2, the home search command has been commented 
    out of the EPICS driver until an Ensemble firmware update resolves this problem.
    </p>
  </li>
  
</ol>

<h2>Known problems with Release 6-4</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    R6-4 had 64-bit compile problems with the PI E816 and Aerotech Ensemble device 
    drivers.  Fixed with R6-4-1 and above.
  </li>
  <p>
  <li>
    Dirk Zimoch (PSI) discovered and fixed a bug in the orginial OMS MAXv driver (R5-4) 
    that caused the home switch status in the response string to be overwritten.  
    Fixed with R6-4-2 and above.
    <p>
  </li>
  <p>
  <li>
    A problem was introduced in R6-4 of the old motor record device drive 
    architecture. If during the move of one or more motors the motor task did not 
    issue an OS delay during status updates, it could potentially not respond to any 
    further motor commands.  Fixed with R6-4-2 and above.
  </li>
  <p>
  <li>
    There is a bug in these motor record versions (R6-4, R6-4-1, R6-4-2)
    that affects motors that have encoders and are configured to do closed-loop 
    control via retries (i.e. UEIP=Yes and RTRY != 0). Retries are not done 
    correctly and occasionally motors exceed their maximum retries and are left at 
    their backlash position; i.e., command position - backlash distance. See the 
    Release Notice for further error conditions. Fixed with R6-4-3 and above.
  </li>
  <p>
  <LI>
    The asynMotor device support in general, and the simulated motor, in particular, 
    had save/restore related problems.  Fixed with R6-4-4 and above.
  </LI>
  <P>
  <LI>
    Previous releases of the Aerotech Ensemble device driver had incorrect Jog 
    speeds, lacked support for a negative PosScaleFactor parameter and did not 
    detect maximum travel limit switch faults correctly. Fixed with R6-4-4 and above.
  </LI>
  <P>
</ol>

<h2>Known problems with Release 6-3</h2>

<OL>
  <LI>
    The OMS VME58 "stale data" problem is caused by the driver communicating via the 
    ASCII commands while the DPRAM was updating.  The OMS VME58 driver was modified 
    with R6-3 to eliminate this contention and the "stale data delay" was set to 
    zero. Since then a problem with OMS VME58 2.24-8S version firmware and all 2.35 
    firmware versions has arisen.  When the user sets the motor record's position, 
    the previous target and readback positions are read from the controller on the 
    next update.
    <P>
    With releases after R6-3 (e.g., R6-3-1 and R6-4) the driver searches all VME58 
    board ID's for either 2.24-8S or any 2.35 version.  If any board is found, the "stale 
    data delay" is set to a non-zero value.
  </LI>
  <P>
  <LI>
    A problem was reported by Emma Shepherd (Diamond) with R6-3 if the "Use RDBL 
    Link" field (URIP) was set to "Yes".  The NTM logic was sending stop commands 
    and issuing the "tdir=.." message to the console if the RDBL link was used. This 
    error was the result of changing the NTM logic as described in item #11 under R6-3 
    modifications.
    <P>
    With releases after R6-3 (e.g., R6-3-1 and R6-4), the NTM logic is restored to 
    using feedback rather than reference positions.  In addition, with release R6-4 
    and after, an "NTM deadband factor" field (NTMF) is added to allow the user to 
    set the NTM deadband; NTM deadband = NTMF * (|BDST| + RDBD) NTMF must be >= 2. 
    If properly configured, the NTM deadband prevents NTM logic from issuing a STOP 
    command at the end of a DC motor move that overshoots its' target position.
  </LI>
  <P>
  <LI>
    The asyn motor device driver architecture does not support the motor record 
    GET_INFO command. Hence, operations that require a status update (i.e., setting 
    the position) were not working. This is fixed in R6-4.
  </LI>
  <P>
  <LI>
    In the process of fixing the OMS VME58 "stale data" problem described above, 
    needless delays were added to the code that updated the VME58's DPRAM.  These 
    needless delays can be calculated as follows;
    <P>
    delay = (n-1) * (1/sysClkRate)
    <P>
    where, n = # of VME58 boards in the IOC.<BR>
    sysClkRate = 60 Hz, unless changed by a sysClkRateSet() from st.cmd.
    <P>
    These delays are eliminated with R6-4-2 and above.
  </LI>
  <P>

    Errors occurred in various motorApp's when building for the solaris-sparc (SUNWspro) 
    target.  SUNWspro users should upgrade to R6-2-1.
  </LI>
  <P>
  <LI>
    Mark River's found and fixed a bug in the motor record.  RDBD was being used in 
    motor record initialization before the RDBD validation check.  This resulted in 
    motor positions not being initialized from save/restore at boot-up if RDBD was 
    not included in a save/restore save set.  This is fixed in R6-2-2.
  </LI>
  <P>
  <LI>
    A bug was introduced into the shell command <B>motorUtilInit</B> affecting these 
    versions of the motor distribution; R6-2, R6-2-1 and R6-2-2.  This bug resulted 
    in the erroneous error message; "motorUtilInit: Prefix %c: has more than 53 
    characters. Exiting". Replace &lt;motor&gt;/motorApp/MotorSrc/motorUtil.cc with 
    the following copy:&nbsp; <A href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/upd/people/sluiter/epics/motor/R6-2/motorUtil.cc">motorUtil.cc</A>

  <P>
  <LI>
    The "alldone" PV in motorUtil.db defaulted to the "moving" state between "iocInit 
    " and "motorUtilInit", giving the false indication that motors were moving 
    during boot-up.  The "alldone" PV now defaults to the "done" state. Replace &lt;motor&gt;/motorApp/Db/motorUtil.db 
    with the following copy:&nbsp; <A href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/upd/people/sluiter/epics/motor/R6-2/motorUtil.db">motorUtil.db</A>

<h2>Known problems with Release 6-1</h2>

<OL>
  <LI>
    The Newport PM500 driver was not issuing the correct command when it queried for 
    the number of axes at boot up. This resulted in a "PM500 system error" message 
    on the 1st axis; fixed in R6-2.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    A bug was introduced with R6-0; the OMS device support was overwriting PID 
    parameter fields during its' normalization calculation; fixed in R6-2.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    There was a bug in the logic that determines the precedence between using the 
    controller's or save/restore's motor position at boot-up. Negative controller 
    positions were not handled correctly; fixed in R6-2
  </LI>
  <LI>
    The home request (HOMF/HOMR) were not cleared when a soft-limit violation 
    occurred; fixed in R6-2.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Due to releasing R6-1 during Newport development, R6-1 can result in linker 
    errors on the symbol "xpsgathering".  Newport users should upgrade to R6-2.
  </LI>
</OL>

<h2>Known problems with Release 6-0</h2>

<OL>
  <LI>
    The R6-0-bugfix CVS repository branch has become corrupted. Hence, no further 
    changes will be made (i.e., bug fixes) to the R6-0 branch.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    A bug was introduced with this release.  The OMS device support overwrites PID 
    parameter fields during its' normalization calculation.  This is fixed in R6-2.
  </LI>
</OL>

<h2>Known problems with Release 5-9</h2>

<OL>
  <LI>
    An undocumented change was made in R5-4 to two OMS setup functions.  Namely, the 
    unused 2nd argument ("axes per card") was eliminated from omsSetup() and 
    oms58Setup().
  </LI>

  <LI>
    Since R4-5 the motor record has required that RDBD be >= MRES.  The test for 
    this condition was done using floating point values.  This caused an occasional 
    error that resulted in the record not always issuing a motor move command when 
    RDBD = MRES and the user issued an incremental move request equal to MRES.  This 
    is fixed with R5-9-1 and R6-0.
  </LI>
  
  <LI>
    A warning message was added with R5-6 when a user attempted to move an OMS motor 
    with an invalid velocity (slew <= base).  Applications that manipulate the
    velocity values are unaware of this restriction and create a torrent of
    these messages.  With release R5-9-1 and R6-0 the OMS device driver will
    only output this warning message once.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    Added a work around for OMS PC68/78 firmware error.  PC68/78 controllers make an 
    erroneous response after they are queried with the "?KP" command at boot-up. 
    This resulted in 1st axis having same position (RP command) as last the axis.  
    This is fixed with R5-9-1 and R6-0.
  </LI>
  
  <LI>
    GPIB under ASYN allows only one input EOS character; no output EOS is allowed.  
    Adjustments were made to the Newport ESP300 driver to accomodate this 
    restriction with R5-9-1 and R6-0.
  </LI>
  
  <LI>
    The CVS repository has become out of synch with the R5-9-1 tar file (motorR5-9-1.tar.gz). 
    Hence, no further changes will be made (i.e., bug fixes) to the R5-9 branch.

    Kevin Peterson (UNI-CAT) and I diagnosed a bug that is in all R3.13 versions of 
    the motor record distribution.  The bug is in the interface between motor record 
    GPIB capable drivers (i.e., Newport MM4000/5/6, MM3000, PM500, ESP300/100) and 
    the EPICS base GPIB driver; drvGpib.<BR>
    Dynamic memory is allocated and shared with drvGpib by the motor task. The 
    problem arises here, at the end of ibLinkTask in drvGpib.c;<BR>

    plink->deviceStatus[pnode->device] = (*(pnode->workStart))(pnode);<BR>

    pnode->workStart is a pointer to gpibIOCallback() in gpibIO.c.  When 
    gpibIOCallback() is done processing it "gives" a semaphore that is "taken" by 
    either gpibIOSend() and gpibIORecv().  Both gpibIOSend() and gpibIORecv() 
    immediately free the shared memory.<BR>

    This works almost all the time; but occasionally the memory is taken by some 
    other task and trashed before the line above is executed resulting in a bus 
    error on "pnode->device".<BR>

    As a quick fix, the task priorities of the all GPIB capable controllers has been 
    lowered below ibLinkTasks priority.  This allows ibLinkTask to finish processing 
    and be waiting for the next GPIB request before the shared memory is de-allocated.
    <BR>

    All users of the R3.13.x version of the motor record distribution that use GPIB 
    to communicate to Newport controllers (i.e., Newport MM4000/5/6, MM3000, PM500, 
    ESP300/100), should upgrade to the R4-9-6 release.

    Two bugs were found and fixed with the Newport MM3000 device support.  First, 
    the enable/disable torque control field (CNEN) was not working.  Second, an 
    error was introduced into the Newport MM3000 device driver with R4-8; the driver 
    was confusing valid responses with the "system error" response from the

<h2>Known problems with Release 4-7</h2>

    Communication with the Newport MM3000 motor controller was getting out of 
    synchronization whenever the MM3000 responded with an error message. This 
    problem was resolved by having recv_mess() in drvMM3000.c detect an error 
    message response, print the error message and then, recursively, call itself. 
    This restored communication transmit/receive synchronization.

    With release R4-7, there was a slight (undocumented) modification made to the 
    way that backlash correction functioned. If a move is in the preferred direction 
    and the backlash speed and acceleration are the same as the slew speed and 
    acceleration, then the backlash move is skipped and the motor moves directly to 
    the target position. Unfortunately, there was a bug in the logic that appeared 
    only when MRES< 0. When MRES < 0, and the backlash speed and acceleration were 
    the same as the slew speed and acceleration, the motor record did the opposite 
    of the requirements; i.e., it did backlash correction when the move was in the 
    preferred direction and did not do backlash correction when the move was not in 
    the preferred direction.

    There were problems with the tweak function (TWF/TWR) when the TWV was set to 
    less than MRES. Under this condition, the following scenario would result. First, 
    tweak forward (TWF).  Since DIFF < MRES, the motor is not moved. Next, tweak 
    reverse (TWR).  Next TWF again.  The motor record does not respond; i.e., DVAL 
    and RVAL are not updated; VAL is not posted. A single tweak, back and forth, 
    confirms that the motor record is not responding.
